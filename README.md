### Analysis on CITES Wildlife Trade Database
By Bianca Iancu and Nik Vaessen

Recently, a new story came to light about the possible extinction of a species [1]. Sudan, a northern white rhino, died in Kenya at the age of 45 due to age related complications. He was the last male individual alive, as northern white rhinos have been hunted and traded over years for their horns, which some think represent a cure for cancer [2]. Although scientists are focusing on creating offspring based on two still living females using newly developed techniques in cellular technology, the success is not guaranteed and Sudan’s death might mark the extinction of his species.

Having this in mind, we decided to focus on analyzing the current situation concerning wildlife trades. For this, the dataset provided by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) [3] was used over a period of four years, from 2013 to 2016. It contains information on the wildlife trades that are carried out around the world, regarding the species that are being traded, the importing and exporting countries, the purpose of the trade, as well as the source.

Multiple aspects were considered during the analysis. First of all, an overview of the general situation was provided, focusing on the species that are traded the most, as well as on the most frequent purposes for trading. Moreover, the most occuring purpose for trade (commercial trade) was further investigated with the attention aimed at determining the most traded species, as well as which countries are the most responsible. Additionally, the way in which the species are being commercially traded, whether as live or in the form of any animal or plant products, was presented.

Finally, a list of the critically endangered species was considered, which was retrieved from World Wild Life [4]. The trades were checked for any observations which might concern species that are currently under a critical threat of extinction.
